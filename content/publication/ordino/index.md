  Ordino is a web-based analysis tool for cancer genomics that allows users to flexibly rank, filter and explore genes, cell lines and tissue samples based on pre-loaded data, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and manually uploaded information. Interactive tabular data visualization that facilitates the user-driven prioritization process forms a core component of Ordino. Detail views of selected items complement the exploration. Findings can be stored, shared and reproduced via the integrated session management.
