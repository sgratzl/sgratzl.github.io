I took over the orphaned [slack-cleaner](https://github.com/sgratzl/slack-cleaner) project. The project aims to easily clean up slack messages which is especially useful for people just using the free account. Besides maintaining the existing code base, I created a modularized version of it at [slack-cleaner2](https://github.com/sgratzl/slack_cleaner2) that allows an easy scripting, deletion, and archiving of messages.
