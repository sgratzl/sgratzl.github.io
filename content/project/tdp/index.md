I developed the Target Discovery Platform (TDP) during my PhD as part a research collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. The platform and its application like [Ordino](https://ordino.caleydoapp.org) or [dTiles](https://dtiles.app.datavisyn.io) build the foundation for the spin-off company [datavisyn](https://www.datavisyn.io). In October 2016, I co-founded the datavisyn GmbH spin-off company together with my professor Marc Streit, Alexander Lex, and Nils Gehlenborg. From 2016 till 2019 I acted as the CTO, head developer, and software architect in the company. Datavisyn develops data visualization solutions for applications in pharmaceutical and biomedical R&D.
