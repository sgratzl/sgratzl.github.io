[LineUp-lite](https://lineup-lite.js.org) is a reimplentation of my [LineUp.js](https://lineup.js.org) LineUp visualization library.
LineUp.js is a heavyweight academic implementation with numerous features that are from high academic interest but only used sparsely.

LineUp-lite is a new implementation based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/adapters/react-table).
This version focusses on the core capabilities such as sorting by multiple attributes, grouping, and cell visualizations.
