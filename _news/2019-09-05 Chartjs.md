I created three new chart.js plugins: [chartjs-chart-graph](https://github.com/sgratzl/chartjs-chart-graph) (for showing graphs and trees), [chartjs-chart-error-bars](https://github.com/sgratzl/chartjs-chart-error-bars) (add error bars for various base type), and [chartjs-chart-geo](https://github.com/sgratzl/chartjs-chart-geo) (create cholorpleth and bubble maps). They were also added to [chart.js awesome list](https://github.com/chartjs/awesome).
