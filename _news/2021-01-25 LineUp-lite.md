Today, I published v1.0.0 of [LineUp-lite](https://lineup-lite.netlify.app). LineUp-lite as a [react-table](react-table.tanstack.com/) based data visualization table React component based inspired by my LineUp visualization technique. It is the small, lightweight nephew of [LineUp.js](https://lineup.js.org).
