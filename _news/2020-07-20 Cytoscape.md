I recently got interested again in (biological) network visualization and start using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/). Besides using, I start extending it with new plugins such for [Bubblesets](https://github.com/upsetjs/cytoscape.js-bubblesets), [Layers](https://github.com/sgratzl/cytoscape.js-layers), and [Overlays](https://github.com/sgratzl/cytoscape.js-overlays).
