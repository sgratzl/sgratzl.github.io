[MiniZinc](https:/www.minizing.org) is a constraint programming language and solver developed by the [Monash university](https://www.monash.edu/) in Melbourne, Australia. Based on a simple language, MiniZinc allow to solve problems such as scheduling problems or travelling salesman problems. During my research visit at Monash university, I contributed to porting MiniZinc to the web using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) and developed tools around that to simplify its usage including a [Web IDE](https://minizinc-ide.netlify.com/) for the language or an easy integration to create interacive tutorials. For example this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/sgratzl/pen/agZKzM) shows how to embed MiniZinc into a website to solve a problem.
