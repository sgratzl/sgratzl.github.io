YaCoBo (Yet another COVID-19 Board) is a dashboard application visualizing COVID-19 data for the US. YaCoBo is hosted at https://yacobo.vercel.app/. It shows data from the [Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) which they collect as part of the [COVIDcast](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) project.

YaCoBo is implemented using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and uses [Lambda Store](https://lambda.store/) for caching. The charts are created using [Vega](https://vega.github.io) statically on the server side with the option to enable interactivity on the client.
