Just finished my internship at [Kitware Inc.](https://www.kitware.com/) working in [Jeff Baumes](https://www.kitware.com/jeffrey-baumes/) group. Working on interesting projects such as MaterialNet, [VIIME](https://github.com/girder/viime), or for the [University of Pennsylvania](https://github.com/Kitware/UPennContrast).
