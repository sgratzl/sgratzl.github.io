[Caleydo](https://caleydo.org) is a research collaboration among Johannes Kepler University Linz, the University of Utah, Graz University of Technology, Harvard University and Harvard Medical School. I joined the team during his Phd studies and together we developed a series of awarded publications in the area of information visualization with a focus on biomedical data.
