Besides development new techniques and tools I was a lecturer at the [Hagenberg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-ooe.at/campus-hagenberg/) from 2016 till 2019, where I taught students the fundamentals of information visualization with a focus on web based visualizations using D3. Moreover, I wrote and maintain a open [D3 v5 tutorial](https://github.com/sgratzl/d3tutorial) hosted on Github.
