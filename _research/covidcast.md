I recently joined the [COVIDCast](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) project by the [Delphi Team at Carnegie Mellon University](https://delphi.cmu.edu). The Delphi Team has a reputation for forecasting flu spread in the US in previous years and started the COVIDCast project for collecting, providing, analyzing, visualizing, and forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic. I joined their visualizing efforts as a consulting contractor applying my engineering and visualization skills.
