          Hi, I am a passionate information visualizer and experienced software architect. I finished my PhD in Computer Science with a focus on Information
          Visualization in 2017 at the
          <a class="secondary" href="https://jku.at">Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria</a>. I love to dig into code, hunt bugs, and design new
          platforms. In addition, I teach Information Visualization classes at universities.

          I like to develop libraries and applications that in one way or the other help others. Like applications that help scientists to explore their
          datasets and find new insights. But also libraries that help developers to create those applications more easily. I value clean structured code that
          is easy to read and maintain.

          is awesome so are
          <a class="secondary" href="https://mypy-lang.org/">Python typings</a>. I'm fluent in frameworks and libraries such as
          <a class="secondary" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, <a class="secondary" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, or
          <a class="secondary" href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> but also the ability to quickly adapt to other environments.

          I'm currently looking for a new challenge in my life. So, if you have some interesting and challenging projects and job opportunities, shoot me a
          message.
